# Sales Revenue Prediction Application (Predictive and Forecasting)

## Author
Name: Simon Lim

## Description
This application involves two machine learning models that were established for business purposes.
One model is a predictive model using a Machine Learning algorithm to accurately predict the sales revenue for a given item in a specific store at a given date.
The other is a forecasting model using a time-series analysis that can forecast the total sales revenue across all stores and items for the next 7 days.
The models have been deployed using Fastapi, Docker and Heroku, which enable modle's access to users online anytime. 

The American retailer that has 10 stores across 3 different states (California (CA), Texas (TX), 
Wisconsin (WI)) sells a variety of items from 3 different categories, including hobbies, foods and 
household. The retailer has a large of amount of data for each itemâ€™s selling price, sales revenue 
and quantity of sales records across stores and dates. In this regard, machine learning and timeseries models can be potentially helpful in a variety of ways by predicting the sales revenue for a 
specific item and forecasting the total revenues for next few days

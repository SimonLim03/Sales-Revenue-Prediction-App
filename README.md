# Flight Fare Prediction App

## Author
Name: Simon Lim

## Description
This application is a machine learning product, which can predict the expected flight fare for different airport trips. 
In particular, this project split the travel airfare into 4 different fares, including minimum, median, modal and mean of airfare
Together, these metrics aim to provide a comprehensive overview of potential fares to users.
To enable model’s access to users, Docker and Streamlit were used for model deployment, enabling users to use the models as a application.


## How to Run the Program
